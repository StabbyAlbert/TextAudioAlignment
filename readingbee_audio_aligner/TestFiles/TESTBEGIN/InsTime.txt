[BEGIN00:11]2:2 And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind,[END00:15][BEGIN00:15] and it filled all the house where they were sitting.[END00:18]
[BEGIN00:18]. 2:3 And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder,[END00:36]
, [BEGIN00:37]like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. 2:4 [END00:46][BEGIN00:46]And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the[END00:56] [BEGIN01:01]Spirit gave them utterance. 2[END01:04]:[BEGIN01:10]5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from[END01:20] [BEGIN01:22]every nation under heaven. [END01:22][BEGIN01:27]2:6 And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language[END01:45][BEGIN01:45]. 2:7 And they were all amazed and[END01:50] [BEGIN01:52]marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans[END01:56][BEGIN01:56]? 2:8 And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born[END02:03][BEGIN02:03]? 2:9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in[END02:09] [BEGIN02:11]Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia[END02:19][BEGIN02:19], 2:10 in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene[END02:37][BEGIN02:37], and sojourners from Rome[END02:43], [BEGIN02:49]both Jews and proselytes, 2:11 Cretans and Arabians[END03:01][BEGIN03:01], we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty[END03:08] [BEGIN03:08]works of God. 2:12 And they were all amazed, and were perplexed,[END03:13] [BEGIN03:17]saying one to another, What meaneth this? 2:13[END03:23] [BEGIN03:26]But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine[END03:33][BEGIN03:33]. 2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven[END03:38], [BEGIN03:42]lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, saying[END03:57][BEGIN03:57], Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell[END04:04] [BEGIN04:12]at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto[END04:16] [BEGIN04:19]my words. 2:15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose[END04:27][BEGIN04:27]; seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 2[END04:37]:[BEGIN04:41]16 but this is that which hath been[END04:48] [BEGIN04:50]spoken through the prophet Joel:[END04:51]

[BEGIN04:53]2:17 And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour forth of my[END05:05] [BEGIN05:05]Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,[END05:10] [BEGIN05:10]And your young men shall see visions, And your old men shall dream dreams: 2[END05:18]:[BEGIN05:19]18 Yea and on my servants[END05:20]
