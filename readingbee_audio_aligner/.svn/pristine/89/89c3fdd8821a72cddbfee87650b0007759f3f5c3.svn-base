CMUSphinx Long Audio Aligner
----------------------------
To compile and run the current version of long audio aligner, we recommend using ANT.

The demo depends on two jars not included in the libs and an audio and text file, namely:
i) sphinx4.jar
ii) WSJ_8gau_13dCep_16k_40mel_130Hz_6800Hz.jar
iii) black_cat1.wav
iv) black_cat1.txt

The jars must be present under ./lib for successful compilation of the code. The wav audio
file must be present in ./resource/wav and the text file in ./resource/transcription/

Instructions to complile and run the code:
 > ant all
