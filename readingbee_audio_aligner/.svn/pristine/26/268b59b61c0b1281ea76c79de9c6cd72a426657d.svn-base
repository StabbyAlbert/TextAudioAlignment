The Azimuthal quantum number (or orbital angular momentum quantum number, second quantum number) symbolized as l (lower-case L) is a quantum number for an atomic orbital that determines its orbital angular momentum and describes the shape of the orbital. The azimuthal quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers which describe the unique quantum state of an electron (the others being the principal quantum number, following spectroscopic notation: the azimuthal quantum number, the magnetic quantum number, and the spin quantum number).
